If you just stumbled upon this repo, I'm sorry, this won't make any sense to you, but you aren't missing out on much.


Alright, I've thrown in a java file for testing. It uses the same version of jogl and gluegen as was used for homework 2.

I personally feel like including all of the libraries in the version control is a bit silly, so I didn't. You'll have to extract the libraries yourself from the contents of homework02/Build/ou-cs-gs/build/install/template/lib

What the program currently does is just set up a 3D viewing space and draw a couple triangles.
